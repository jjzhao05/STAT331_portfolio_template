[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an B.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

**WD-1: I can import data from a *variety* of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).**

-   `csv`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv

teacher_evals_compare <- read_csv(here("data", "teacher_evals.csv"))

#Challenge 3 Question 1

```

-   `xlsx`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx

military <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Share of Govt. spending", 
                      skip  = 7, 
                      n_max = 190,
                      na = c(". .", "xxx" )
                      )
#Practice Activity 4 Question 3
```

-   `txt`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-txt

ages_mystery <- read_delim(file = here::here("Week 2",
                                             "Check-ins",
                                             "Ages_Data",

                           delim = "|")

#Week 2 Check In
```

**WD-2: I can select necessary columns from a dataset.**

```{r}
#| label: wd-2

  select(id, name.x, plate_number, gender)

#Lab 5
#Added right_join()
```

**WD-3: I can filter rows from a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric

```{r}

**WD-4: I can modify existing variables and create new variables in a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

## Reproducibility

**R-1: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the here package.**

I've done this in the following provided assignments:

Labs 1 - 9, Challenges 1 - 9

**R-2: I can write well documented and tidy code.**

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I revised the majority of my labs and challenges throughout this course. The vast majority of the code in the portfolio is post-revision, and typically is consisted of changing small mistakes that comes from misreading the problem, or an inefficiency or a bad way of conducting the cleaning of data. I think that my reflections are present, but do miss some of the bigger picture ideas. In some cases, such as in Lab 5, my original ideas were flawed, and I had to extensively redo my thinking in order to demonstrate my understanding, as shown in the above portfolio. I do make an attempt to fix errors in future assignments, such as including code wrapping in the yaml after the first couple labs.

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I attempted the harder difficulty in the only challenge where I could choose a higher difficulty(Challenge 2). I think that I would do a harder difficulty in order to try to be more proficient in R, but there have not been too many challenges where I could choose a higher difficulty. I did go back to revise my work outside of the revisions, in order to utilize more difficult ideas as shown above. This can be shown in using an anti_join() rather than using a left_join with a filter to filter for a person who did not have an interview(wd-6-anti).

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

![](images/clipboard-1590801814.png)

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

I think that during group work, I worked well with my group mates. I did try to follow the developer/coder roles, but it did tend to fall apart a little when we encounter challenges. I feel like a more flexible structure was good for solving problems, as each person could test out their ideas, without being hamstrung by communication problems or any other misunderstandings of what each group member wanted to use. I was not controlling and work well by communicating and being open to other ideas. I am always patient with my groupmates when we have conflicting ideas in approach to a problem , and we try each other's potential solutions, rather than me overpowering them with my own ideas. I have learned to figure out problems and challenges with my various group mates during the PAs very well, and this was probably my favorite part of the course.
